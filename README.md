# ☀️ IE Sustainability Datathon 2025: Solar Optimization for CO₂ Reduction

## 📍 Project Overview

In the 2025 IE Sustainability Datathon, our team tackled a real-world challenge posed by Repsol: **how can industrial plants maximize solar self-consumption and reduce CO₂ emissions through intelligent forecasting and battery optimization?**

We developed a complete solution that:
- Forecasts maximum solar generation using ML
- Optimizes battery usage for self-consumption or carbon impact
- Quantifies avoided CO₂ emissions (direct and lifecycle)


## 👥 Team

Ricardo Urech, Blanca Burgaleta, Ana Cortés, Vibhushan Balaji & Tomás Valbuena


## 🚀 Key Highlights

- 📈 **XGBoost model (weekday-only)** achieved **MAE = 4.91 kWh**
- ⚡ Optimization increased solar self-consumption (Ra) from **82.36% to 85.26%**
- 🌍 CO₂ optimization avoided **+5,000 gCO₂eq** more emissions
- 🧪 Lifecycle emissions analysis showed **124,028 gCO₂eq avoided**
